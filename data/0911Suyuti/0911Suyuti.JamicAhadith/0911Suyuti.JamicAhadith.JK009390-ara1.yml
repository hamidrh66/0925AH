90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK009390 contains multiple texts: 
    1. vols. 1-9: a composite text based al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaghīr 
        (+ additions) and al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr
    2. vols. 10-11: al-Munāwī's al-Sharḥ al-Azhar
        (a continuation of al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr)
    3. vol. 12: aḥādīth mawḍūʿa (fabricated ḥadīth) extracted from 
        al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaghīr (+ additions) and al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr
    4. vols. 13-21: masānīd (ḥadīths with a full isnād going back to the first authority)
        and marāsīl (ḥadīths not traceable to the first generation after the Prophet)
        extracted from al-Suyūṭī's al-Jāmiʿ al-ṣaghīr 
        (+ additions) and al-jāmiʿ al-kabīr
    PV converted the native tagging into OpenITI tags.
    The tags included `| 40 WORDS 40` or `$ 40 WORDS 40 $`, 
    in which WORDS is usually a name, that is repeated after the second `40`
    (sometimes the first letter or two of the WORDS was before the first `40`
    and the WORDS then continued after the second `40`: e.g. `A\n# | 40 Anas 40 nas`.
    PV removed these tags and the WORDS between them.
    NB: the file still contains a large number of native tags: 
    * `# | 30`: start of the matn of a ḥadīth?
    * `# $ 30`: start of an alternative version of a ḥadīth??
    Consider splitting the text file into separate documents?
