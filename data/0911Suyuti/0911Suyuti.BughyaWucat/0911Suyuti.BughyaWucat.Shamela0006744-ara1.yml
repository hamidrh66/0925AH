90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Cornelia Neubauer; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was tagged by Cornelia, vetted by Gowaart. Annotation was largely fine, I have deleted the editorial section and have refomatted the last section's titles to only highlight the numbering as there are no actual headers here. I have formatted the poetry in the text. Cornelia noted one pagination issue, but in fact there were many more, with currently 870 search matches for V00P000 in the text, i.e. the majority of the pages have not been noted. It appears that the page boundaries are nevertheless correct (barring the one noted by Cornelia: "In one case the pagination of the shamela text did not correspond to the PDF: between pageV02P406 and page V02P407"), so this should be possible to fix with a script. I corrected two such pages before I realised there are too many of them, so I left this as is. For now, the text is still easily navigable because of the numbered biographies.
